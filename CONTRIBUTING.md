# Contributing Guidelines

For anybody who knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute! When contributing, you should follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/scratch-contributors/scratch-contributors.github.io/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing issues

Found a bug? Report it! Be sure to check if it is already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/scratch-contributors/scratch-contributors.github.io/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

Also, feel free to ask questions, suggest new features, and more!

## Creating Pull Requests

Contributions are welcome! Be sure to file an issue first (see above). If you know a fix for that issue, or you know a fix for a different one, you can create a pull request. Fork this repository, create a new branch from the 'master' branch, and make your changes on the new branch. Now, create a pull request on the origin repository (scratch-contributors/scratch-contributors.github.io). We will review your pull request.
Remember: If you are contributing to resolve an issue and it has already been assigned to somebody, DO NOT CREATE A PULL REQUEST!
