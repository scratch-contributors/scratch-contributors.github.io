# scratch-contributors.github.io

The site for the scratch group "Scratch Contributors".

You may be looking for the [source](/src) code of the website. This is located in the [src](/src) folder.

This is a Nuxt.js-based site which is deployed to GitHub with [this workflow](https://github.com/scratch-contributors/scratch-contributors.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml). Nuxt.js also made it easier to render the contributors page.
