I believe in Assuming Good Faith — that is, believing that no action is intended to break the Scratch CG's or be mean, even if it looks that way on the surface. I have a Scratch Wiki account, but I'm rarely active on it as I could never get my head around the editor! I used to program in a different (and simpler) programming tool, but it shut down so I moved to Scratch. I'm currently trying to recreate a game which I made in the old language — I've been working on it for over a year now! I also maintain a website for the game, because a website shows everyone that you're serious. Thanks everybody! See you around!"},{name:"ScratchTag-",bio:"Helooi! I'm ScratchTag-, commonly known as tag. I predominantly contribute scratch as a PPTBF curator, Scratch wiki editor etc. moreover, I also help new scratchers and other scratch-related activities. I am very much interested in helping and cooperating with community because It gives my the positivity when hearing the scratchers' kind words and I am thankful to the scratch team for making this website.\nThanks"},{name:"aderne5739",bio:"Hi! I'm aderne5739, aka Ade. I'm a Wiki contributor. I ride horses and love to read! I like to contribute because I love grammar and I figured I would help people with their's.
